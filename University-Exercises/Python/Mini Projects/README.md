# Mini Projects
This folder includes small mini projects in python designed to practice programming skills and basic problem solving. Each project is independent and techniques.

## Projects Included
- **Matrix Multiplicatin**
- **Simple Banking System**

## Purpose
- Using functions
- Working With lists and loops.
- Using conditional statments.
- Handling user input and data validation.
- Implementing menu-driven programs.
- Applying mathematical logic.

## How To Use
- Open the folder of the project you want to try.
- Read the README.md inside that project folder for instructions.
- Run the Python in a Python 3 environmnet.

## Future Plans
- Add more projects from time to time.
- Using some special libraries such as NumPy and Pandas in the projects.
- Using Functions in the projects.
