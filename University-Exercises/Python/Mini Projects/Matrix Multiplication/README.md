# Matrix Multiplication breif description

#### First of all I would like to thank professor Gilbert Strang form whom I learned linear Algebra in the best possible way.

## Purpose
This program is designed to multiply two matrices without using the NumPy library or other external libraries.

## Key Concepts
- The number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix.
- Each element of the resulting matrix is calculated as the **dot product** of a row from the **first matrix** and a columns from the **second matrix**.
- **Rows**: Same as the first matrix
- **Columns**: Same as the second matrix.

## Objectives
- Take user input to define matrices.
- Multiply matrices using nested loops.
- Save and show the result.
  
## Skills Practiced
- Working with lists of lists in Python.
- Using nested loops.
- Applying mathematical operations in programming.
- Understanding matrix dimentions and rules.
